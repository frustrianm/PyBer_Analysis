# PyBer with Matplotlib - FRM's Tec Data Bootcamp Challenge #5

## Overview of the pyber analysis
A new task is assigned to our boss Omar and us to help V.Isualize with the analysis of PyBer's data regarding fares, drivers and cities divided in 3 sections: rural, suburban and urban. We'll proceed to use our new skills with Matplotlib, and reuse our knowledge of Pandas, to create dataframes and graphs to get helpful insights regarding strategies and actions to be taken upon our findings.

## Summary

### Recommendation 1
Rural drivers are the least in quantity of total drivers, but they earn the most, despite producing the lowest income for PyBer, as can be seen in the "Total Fares" result. Following this trend, a business decision that could be taken would be to axe the rural cities and to focus marketing and operations resources mainly in urban cities, where are the most drivers who receive earn the least and produce the highest income to PyBer. This decision would obviously place a limit in PyBer's reach as an app, but big businesses as Citi Group have recently decided to sell their least profitable business branches and to use the sales income to empower their main income streams and such could be a path for Pyber.

### Recommendation 2
If axing rural cities is not between the cards of PyBer, definitely any new services for rural cities could be offered to produce higher income and to make an efficient use of the current drivers in such cities. Other competitor apps offer services such as sendings of any type between two destinations, and an innovator way to also make use of the suburban drivers, when out of the initial office hours, would be to offer food or products delivery from suburban cities to rural cities where access to these offerings is scarce. That's something that competitor apps don't offer right now (they offer only certaing reach for delivery) and would position PyBer as the to go app for any mobility service needed, while the high costs of such service would not affect current rates as it can be seen in the "Total Average Fare per Ride" result that rural users are the ones paying the most, due to long distances, so the price is expected and the delivery service is innovative.

### Recommendation 3
The trend is our business friend. As can be seen in the "Total Fare by City Type" result, there are peaks in usage of PyBer in the last days of February. Visits of beloved ones to other cities or locations of all the ones who couldn't spend Valetine Day together? It could be a reason and packages could be offered in cases for food delivery to the destination at the same time of arrival, to be previously sent to the destinarion before arrival or to be ordered and picked in site as part of the travel. Trends can be understood with qualitative data found in news and social media trends, and even as it implies more data analysis, it definitely could boost PyBer's income by adapting to their market when it's on the rise to milk as much as possible of its clients as well when it declines to maintain itself as the top of mind app to go for mobility even when not many users are using PyBers services (such as the beginning of February, March and the ending of April). More data analysis and more marketing.
